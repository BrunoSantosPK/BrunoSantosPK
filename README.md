My purpose is create things and make positive impact for people. I enjoy gamification techniques and often include a little im my projects.

I work with back-end, but sometimes I make a few projects in front-end. My master skills are Python, JavaScript and TypeScript. I use Node.js and Flask as frameworks back-end full stack. Create a full ecosystem around my data projects is my main goal.

My current project is a platform for improve self knowledge. For this, I use psycometric techniques, gamification process and machine learning, to create a simple and intuitive system to evaluate and motivate users.
